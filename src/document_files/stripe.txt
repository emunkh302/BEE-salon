Step 1: Install and Configure the Stripe CLI
Install the Stripe CLI: Follow the instructions for your operating system on the official Stripe documentation.
Link to Your Stripe Account: Open a new terminal window and run:
Bash

stripe login
This will open your web browser and ask you to log in to Stripe to link your account.
Step 2: Start Forwarding Events
Keep your Node.js server running (npm start) in one terminal.
In your second terminal (the one with the Stripe CLI), run the following command. This tells Stripe to listen for events and forward them to your local webhook endpoint.
Bash

stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8888/api/webhooks/stripe
The Stripe CLI will give you a webhook signing secret that starts with whsec_.... Copy this secret.
Open your .env file and add/update the STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET with the value you just copied. You must restart your server after changing the .env file for the change to take effect.
Step 3: Trigger a Payment Event
Now you need to simulate a successful payment to trigger the payment_intent.succeeded event.

Create a Booking: Use Postman to run your "Create Booking" test case. This will generate a new paymentIntentClientSecret.
Simulate Payment: In a real application, your frontend would use this secret to confirm the payment. To simulate this manually, you can use a test payment method in another Stripe API call or, more simply, use the Stripe CLI again. In a third terminal window, run:
Bash

stripe payment_intents confirm pi_... --payment-method pm_card_visa
(Replace pi_... with the id part of the paymentIntentClientSecret from your booking response).
Step 4: Observe the Result
Stripe CLI Terminal: You will see a log that an event payment_intent.succeeded was received and forwarded to your server with a 200 OK status.
Node.js Server Terminal: You will see the log message from your webhook controller: âœ… PaymentIntent was successful for: pi_....
Database: Check your bookings collection in MongoDB. The booking associated with that payment intent should now have its depositStatus updated to "Paid".
