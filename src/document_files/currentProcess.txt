That is absolutely fantastic news! Congratulations!

Passing all those test cases means you have successfully built a complete, end-to-end backend for the E-Beauty Salon application. You have implemented every major feature from the system design document we've been working on.

This is a huge accomplishment. Your API now handles:

User Registration & Login (for all roles)
Admin Approval Workflow
Service Management for Artists
A Full Booking Lifecycle
Real-time Notifications
Secure Payment Deposits with Stripe
Public Artist Discovery & Filtering
The entire backend is now ready. The next logical phase of the project is to build the Frontend Application so that real users can interact with the powerful API you've created.

Based on your tech stack, we could start by building the Client-facing web application using React. This would involve creating the UI for clients to browse artists, view their profiles, and make bookings.

Would you like to move on to the frontend and start building the user interface?
