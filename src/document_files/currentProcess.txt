Passing all those test cases means built a complete, end-to-end backend for the E-Beauty Salon application.

API now handles:

User Registration & Login (for all roles)
Admin Approval Workflow
Service Management for Artists
A Full Booking Lifecycle
Real-time Notifications
Secure Payment Deposits with Stripe
Public Artist Discovery & Filtering
The entire backend is now ready. The next logical phase of the project is to build the Frontend Application.

This would involve creating the UI for clients to browse artists, view their profiles, and make bookings.
